							<p>The World Bio-Bridges Mission is dedicated to funding projects that extend and expand the innovative Bio-Bridges conservation initiative, connecting areas of rich biodiversity that are under threat to protect some of the world’s most endangered animals. The World Bio-Bridges Mission has been established to build on the hugely successful launch of Bio-Bridges in Summer 2016, which pioneered projects in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, engaging millions of customers to do their bit in helping threatened orang-utans, tigers, and monkeys.</p>

The World Bio-Bridges Mission funding will vary in terms of location, conservation partner, habitat and region. The philosophy of the programme is closely aligned with the Future Fit Business Benchmark, a

By connecting our corporate philanthropy, we are able to use the Advisory Team’s combined knowledge and experience to build new Bio-Bridges and exceed our ambitious Enrich Not Exploit™ target of protecting and regenerating 75 million square metres of habitat by 2020, helping communities to live more sustainably.</p><p>“Bio-Bridges!? What, like the one they were going to build over the Thames? No, much more useful than that, and a little more remote. Wild animals need to swing and leap freely through the trees and not be restricted to what few diminishing patches of wild habitat are left. What do they need to be able to cross safely from one patch to another? Bio-Bridges. There are never enough!”</p>
