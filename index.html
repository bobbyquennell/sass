                    <p class="header-tagline">1 YEAR ON FROM THE LAUNCH OF THE ENRICH NOT EXPLOIT&trade; COMMITMENT</p>
                    <p class="header-tagline">
                    In 2016, we set ourselves 14 ambitious targets as our first steps towards becoming a truly sustainable global business.  We have an ambition to have no negative impact on our planet and society and take meaningful action to allow us all to flourish forever.
                    <br>Since launching our Enrich Not Exploit™ Commitment we’ve been busy turning our vision into reality and we are proud to share our first progress report. Instead of a written sustainability report, we’ve made a series of short videos, one for each target plus introductions, to show you what we’ve achieved so far. We have faced a number of challenges, some expected, some unexpected, but we’re pleased to be heading in the right direction.  </p>
                    <p class="header-tagline">
                    To read more about the Future Fit Business Benchmark, the inspiration behind our targets and our goal to being a truly sustainable business, please <a href="http://futurefitbusiness.org/">click here</a>.</p>
